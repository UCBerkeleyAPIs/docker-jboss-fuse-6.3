### FUSE Docker image

This project builds a Docker image for [JBoss Fuse](http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/) with a default users.properties configuration file.

### Usage

Run the image:

    docker run -it -p 8181:8181 artnaseef/jboss-fuse-6.3-admin:redhat-329

The administration console should be available at [http://localhost:8181/hawtio](http://localhost:8181/hawtio)

### Ports Opened by Fuse

You may need to map ports opened by the Fuse container to host ports if you need to access it's services.
Those ports are:

* 8181 - Web access (also hosts the Fuse admin console).
* 8101 - SSH Karaf console access

If you add the ``-p 8181:8181` to your `docker run` command, then you should be able to load [http://localhost:8181/hawtio](http://localhost:8181/hawtio) in your web browser to mange the Fuse server.

If you add the ``-p 8101:8101` to your `docker run` command, then you should be able to ssh into the Karaf container using a command similar to: `ssh admin@localhost -p 8101`
